# README.md Generator

## Description

See below for application details, and for screenshots of example responses and of the README.md file they generate; reference the YouTube link for a walkthrough demonstration of the application and its tests.

### About the Application

This application was created to help avoid the tedium of writing a README.md file from scratch; the application will generate a README.md template, and autopopulate the respective README fields based on user input in the terminal.

The Node.js runtime environment is required to run the contents of this application. You can download Node.js here:

```
npm init -y

npm install --save inquirer@^8.0.0
```

## Usage

1. Open a terminal
2. Navigate to the "Develop" folder in the repository
3. Type the following command:

```
node index.js
```

A new README.md file will be generated within the "Develop" folder with user inputs.

For information on how to test the code, see [Tests](#tests) below.
